# parted And Partition Alignment

## General

- parted will try to align newly created partitions. But only if the partition
start/end are a bit 'fuzzy'. For example:

 - 'parted p ext2 1% 2%' will give nicely aligned partitions; so does
 - 'parted p ext2 1MB 2MB'. But the supposedly more correct
 - 'parted p ext2 1MiB 2MiB' will **not** do what you (well, at least I did) expect. The partition size will be 1 MiB + 1 sector.
 
- parted does **not** align to cylinder sizes

- parted will align to 1MiB, unless the underlying raid config does
have a chunk size which is not a power of 2 and smaller than 1MiB. In that case parted aligns to
chunk size * 'usable disks' - see details below.
_This seems to be inconsistent to me. 1MiB * 'usable disks' would be more logical._

- default mdadm chunksize seems to be 0.5MiB

- with dos partition label, space for an additional sector must be taken into account between logical partitions.

## Normal Disk

- parted aligns to 1MiB

## RAID

### setup using mdadm

	mdadm --create /dev/md0 -R -l 0 -c 32 -n 3 /dev/sdb /dev/sdc /dev/sdd
	# raid 0, 32k chunks, 3 disks
	# mdadm --detail /dev/md0
	mdadm --stop /dev/md0

### setup using dmraid

*[extremely weird syntax, depending on raid type]*

	dmsetup create foo --table "0 $((2*10485760*3)) striped 3 64 /dev/sdb 0 /dev/sdc 0 /dev/sdd 0"
	# raid 0, 3 disks, 64 sector chunks
	dmsetup create foo --table "0 $((2*10485760*3)) raid raid5_la 1 64 4 - /dev/sdb - /dev/sdc - /dev/sdd - /dev/sde"
	# raid5, 64 sector chunks, 4 disks
	# dmsetup info foo
	# dmsetup table foo
	dmsetup remove foo

- raid 0

  - align to n * chunksize or 1MiB

- raid 1

  - align to 1MiB

- raid 5, 6

  - (n-1,2) * chunksize or 1MiB

- raid 10

  - n/2 * chunksize or 1MiB


## Conclusion

Letting parted decide on the exact partition sizes seems to be prone to
achive unpredictable results. It might be better to deal with it inside
libstorage.
