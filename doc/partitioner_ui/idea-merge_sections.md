## Merge "Hard Disks" and "RAID" sections

This is part of the [bigger document](../partitioner_ui.md) about rethinking the YaST Partitioner
user interface.

This is one of the ideas that was considered (and then discarded) during the development of Leap
15.1. It consisted on merging disks and RAIDs in a common branch of the left-hand tree, since they
are pretty much the same and support similar operations. The idea is presented for completeness in
[this mockup](./merge_raids_section.pdf).
