## Template idea

This is part of the [bigger document](../partitioner_ui.md) about rethinking the YaST Partitioner
user interface.

For clarity, it likely makes sense to keep each idea under discussion in its own separate Markdown
file, with the corresponding mockups as images. So please folow this template when proposing an
alternative UI for the Partitioner or any other idea to overcome the current limitations/problems
exposed in the main document.
