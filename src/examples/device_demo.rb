device_demo.rb [OPTIONS]

Probe device tree or read device tree from YAML file, optionally propose a
new device tree, and then either show the new tree as graphics or write the
new tree as YAML file to stdout.

If no option is given, read from fake-devicegraphs.yml.

Options:
  --yaml YAML_FILE      Read device tree from YAML_FILE
  --probe               Probe device tree.
  --propose             Propose new device tree.
  --gfx                 Show device tree as graphics.
  --help                Write this text.
