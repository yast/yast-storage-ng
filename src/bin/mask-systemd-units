# This script can mask or unmask systemd mount and swap units since systemd
# and YaST mounting the same file system leads to race conditions (see bsc
# #1073633). Unfortunately there is no single systemctl command to mask those
# units - so each must be masked individually.

# Since it is unclear how to identify mount and swap units generated by the
# systemd-gpt-auto-generator (see bsc #1073633 comment #79) this script
# masks/unmasks almost all mount and swap units.

# Error messages about non-existing units may be wrong (see bsc #1095973).
