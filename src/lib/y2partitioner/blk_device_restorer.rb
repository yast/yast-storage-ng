module Y2Partitioner
  # Class that makes possible to restore the filesystem or partition table
  # that was associated to a given block device in a previous point in time.
  #
  # This is used by the Partitioner to implement the "Do Not Format" option
  # (it restores the filesystem in the system devicegraph) and to implement
  # removing devices from the in-memory representation of an MD or LVM (it
  # restores the filesystem or the empty partition table that was associated
  # to the device when it was initially added to the MD or LVM).
  class BlkDeviceRestorer

    # Target device
    #
    # This device must be associated to the current devicegraph (see
    # {DeviceGraphs#current}). Its status and descendants will be updated with
    # every call to {#restore_from_checkpoint} or {#restore_from_system}.

    # was either empty or formatted, no matter whether it was encrypted or not.

    # In other words, the current implementation return false if the device
    # was an LVM PV, part of an MD RAID or part of any similar complex setup.
