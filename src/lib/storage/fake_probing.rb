    # Class to build faked device graphs in libstorage instead of doing real
    # hardware probing. This can be used to create device graphs from YAML
    # files or directly with libstorage calls. The objective is to achieve
    # broader test coverage with faked hardware setups that would be difficult
    # to set up with real hardware, much less with virtualized hardware.
    #
    # An instance of this class must be created before any other libstorage
    # calls to make sure it is properly initialized, i.e. without real hardware
    # probing.
