  # Bcache technology supports two types of bcache devices. Bcache devices with a backing
  # device and also bcache devices directly created over a caching set (without backing
  # device associated to it). This second type is known as flash-only bcache.

  # This is a wrapper for the Storage::BcacheType enum
