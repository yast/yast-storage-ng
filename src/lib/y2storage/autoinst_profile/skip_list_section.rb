    # Devices skip list in a <drive> section of an AutoYaST profile.
    #
    # This class determines when a device should be skipped based on a set of
    # predefined rules.
    #
    # Let's consider the following skip list in an AutoYaST profile:
    #
    #   <drive>
    #     <skip_list config:type="list">
    #       <listentry>
    #         <skip_key>driver</skip_key>
    #         <skip_value>usb-storage</skip_value>
    #       </listentry>
    #       <listentry>
    #         <skip_key>size_k</skip_key>
    #         <skip_value>1048576</skip_value>
    #         <skip_if_less_than config:type="boolean">true</skip_if_less_than>
    #       </listentry>
    #     </skip_list>
    #   </drive>
    #
