    # This class holds a list of planned devices and offers an API to query the collection
    #
    # Instances of this classes are immutable, so methods like {#append} or {#prepend} will return
    # new instances.
    #
    # @example Create a collection
    #   disk = Disk.new
    #   vg = LvmVg.new
    #   collection = DevicesCollection.new([disk, vg])
    #
    # @example Filter by device type (e.g., disk devices)
    #   sda = Disk.new
    #   sdb = Disk.new
    #   vg = LvmVg.new
    #   collection = DevicesCollection.new([sda, sdb, vg])
    #   collection.disks #=> [sda, sdb]
    #
    # @example Combining collections
    #   disk = Disk.new
    #   vg = LvmVg.new
    #   collection0 = DevicesCollection.new([disk])
    #   collection1 = DevicesCollection.new([vg])
    #   combined = collection0.append(collection1)
    #   combined.devices #=> [disk, vg]
