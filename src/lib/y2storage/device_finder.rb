    # This is different from {BlkDevice.find_by_any_name} in several ways:
    #
    # * It will find any matching device, not only block devices (e.g. LVM VGs
    #   also have a name but are not block devices).
    # * It can be called on any devicegraph, not only probed.
    # * It uses a system lookup only when necessary (i.e. all the cheaper
    #   methods for finding the device have been unsuccessful).
    # * It avoids system lookup in potentially risky scenarios (like an outdated
    #   {StorageManager#probed}).
