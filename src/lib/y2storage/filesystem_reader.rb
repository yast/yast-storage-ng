    # @note libstorage-ng has a couple of ways for immediate mounting/unmounting devices, but
    #   they cannot be easily used here.
    #
    #   For example, BlkFilesystem::detect_content_info uses an internal EnsureMounted object.
    #   EnsureMounted mounts a given filesystem during its construction and unmounts it during
    #   its destruction. In ruby there is no a clear way of calling the destructor of a binding
    #   object, so EnsureMounted cannot be used for a temporary mount to inspect the filesystem
    #   content from YaST and then unmount it.
    #
    #   Besides that, MountPoint offers MountPoint::immediate_activate and ::immediate_deactivate,
    #   but these methods only can be used with probed mount points. Internally, these methods
    #   use Mountable::Impl::immediate_activate and ::immediate_deactivate. Such methdos could
    #   be offered in the public API, but they require to create a temporary mount point for the
    #   filesystem to mount. Creating a mount point could have some implications, see
    #   {Device#update_etc_status}, and moreover, a possible existing mount point should be
    #   correctly restored.
    #
    #   The library API needs to be extended to easily mount/umount a device in an arbitrary
    #   path without modifying the device (i.e., without changing its current mount point).
