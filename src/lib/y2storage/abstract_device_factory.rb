  # Abstract factory class to generate device trees and similar objects with
  # a tree structure from YAML. The FakeDeviceFactory is one example subclass.
  #
  # This class uses introspection and duck-typing with a number of predefined
  # methods that a subclass is required to implement.
  #
  # Subclasses are required to implement a create_xy() method for each
  # factory product 'xy' the factory is able to create and some methods to
  # support some basic sanity checks of the generated device tree:
  #
  # - valid_hierarchy()
  # - valid_toplevel()
  # - valid_param()
  #
  # Optional:
  # - fixup_param()
  # - dependencies()
  #
  # From the outside, use load_yaml_file() or build_tree() to start
  # generating the tree.
  #
  # Avoid create_xy() methods that are not factory methods.
