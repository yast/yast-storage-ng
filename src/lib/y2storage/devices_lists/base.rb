      # When using a list of attributes, it automatically handles the situation
      # of libstorage objects raising an exception when the value of an
      # attribute is not found. Thus, example_partition.filesystem is considered
      # nil if the partition is not formatted, although default libstorage
      # behavior is to raise an exception instead of returning nil.
      #
      # It returns a list of the same time to allow chaining several calls
