    # ({Y2Storage::Planned::Partition} and {Y2Storage::Planned::StrayBlkDevice}).

      # It supports three different kind of specifications:

      # * Old Xen partitioning, which relies in a non-existent device to group similar ones
      #   (for instance, `/dev/xvda` to group `/dev/xvda1`, `/dev/xvda2`, etc.).
      # * New Xen partitioning, which uses stray block devices.
      # * Regular disks.
