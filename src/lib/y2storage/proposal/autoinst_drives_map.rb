      # Whether the given <drive> section represents a set of Xen virtual
      # partitions
      #
      # FIXME: this is a very simplistic approach implemented as bugfix for
      # bsc#1085134. A <drive> section is only considered to represent a set of
      # virtual partitions if ALL its partitions contain an explicit
      # partition_nr that matches with the name of a stray block device. If any
      # of the <partition> subsections does not include partition_nr or does not
      # match with an existing device, the whole drive is discarded.
      #
      # NOTE: in the future the AutoYaST profile will hopefully allow a more
      # flexible usage of disks. Then Xen virtual partitions could be
      # represented as disks in the profile (which matches reality way better),
      # and there will be no need to improve this method much further.
      #
      # See below for an example of an AutoYaST profile for a system with
      # the virtual partitions /dev/xvda1, /dev/xvda2 and /dev/xvdb1. That
      # example includes two devices /dev/xvda and /dev/xvdb that really do
      # not exist in the system.
      #
      # So this method checks if the given <drive> section contains a set of
      # <partition> subsections that correspond to existing Xen virtual
      # partitions (stray block devices) in the system.
      #
      # @example AutoYaST profile for Xen virtual partitions
      #   <drive>
      #     <device>/dev/xvda</device>
      #     <partition>
      #       <partition_nr>1</partition_nr>
      #       ...information about /dev/xvda1...
      #     </partition>
      #     <partition>
      #       <partition_nr>2</partition_nr>
      #       ...information about /dev/xvda2...
      #     </partition>
      #   </drive>
      #
      #   <drive>
      #     <device>/dev/xvdb</device>

      #       ...information about /dev/xvdb1...

      # @param devicegraph [Devicegraph] Devicegraph
      # @return [Boolean] false if there are no partition sections or they do
