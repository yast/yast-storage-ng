module Y2Storage
  module Proposal
    # This class is responsible for creating (or updating) a partition table in a given device.
    #
    # It takes the partition table type for a planned device and:
    #
    # * If no partition table exists, it creates a new one.
    # * If the partition table already contains any partition, do nothing.
    # * If a partition table of the same type already exists, just do nothing.
    # * If no partition table type is specified (there is no planned partition table type),
    #   then use the preferred type for the device.
