module Y2Storage
  module EncryptionMethod
    # Base class for encryption methods.
    #
    # Encryption method classes offer an API to:
    #
    # * determine whether a encryption method is available in the running system (see
    #   {#available?}),
    # * find out which method was used to encrypt a given device (see {#used_for?}),
    # * encrypt a device. In this case, it relies on {Y2Storage::EncryptionProcesses} classes.
