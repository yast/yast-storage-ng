    # Base class for swap encryption methods.
    #
    # Note that system hibernation does not work when using a volatile key for encrypting a swap device
    # (see {RandomSwap}, {ProtectedSwap} and {SecureSwap}). For these encryption methods, the swap is
    # re-encrypted during the boot process and its previous content is lost.
    #
    # The system does not prevent hibernation when using a volatile key. To prevent hibernation,
    # 'hibernate' target must be masked (i.e., systemctl mask hibernate.target).
    #
    # YaST does not offer any mechanism to prevent hibernation either. If a swap encryption method is
    # used, the user is responsible of configuring the system to avoid hibernation (as suggested in the
    # help of the encryption dialog). In case YaST will offer any way to disable hibernation, make sure
    # to also offer an option to enable it again easily.
