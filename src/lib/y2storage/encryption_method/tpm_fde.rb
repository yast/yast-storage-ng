    # Encryption method that allows to encrypt a device using LUKS2 and configure the unlocking
    # process via the system TPM using the fde-tools created by SUSE.
    #
    # This is a quite special encryption method due to the way the fde-tools work. First of all,
    # if this method is used, it must be used at least for the root (/) filesystem and only
    # additionally for some other devices.
    #
    # Check the documentation of fde-tools for further information.

      # @todo Not sure if this would be possible at the end, since the exact way to setup the
      # system using fde-tools is still changing too often. In any case, having a precise result
      # for this method will only be relevant when implementing support for creating encrypted
      # devices in an installed system. During installation returning always false is perfectly
      # correct.

      # In this initial implementation this always returns false because there are important
      # limitations to use this in (Auto)YaST:
      #
      # - The current version of the inst-sys cannot talk to the TPM
      # - There is still no corresponding UI in the Expert Partitioner
      # - Some mechanism to ensure consistency (eg. checking all devices use the same recovery
      #   password) need to be introduced
      # - The current implementation of the encryption method only covers system installation
      #   (with no support to add a new encrypted device to a system already using fde-tools)
      #
      # So far, the encryption method is implemented to be used by Agama (which doesn't honor
      # the {#available?} method.
