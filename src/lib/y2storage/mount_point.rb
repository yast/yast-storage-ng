    #   * DEVICE: For NFS, the server and path. For regular filesystems, the
    #     kernel device name or a link in /dev (but not in /dev/disk) of the
    #     block device that contains the filesystem.
    #   * UUID: The UUID of the filesystem.

    #   * ID: one of the links in /dev/disk/by-id to the block device
    #     containing the filesystem.
    #   * PATH: one of the links in /dev/disk/by-path to the block device
    #     containing the filesystem.
