require "y2storage/storage_class_wrapper"

module Y2Storage
  # Class representing a certain space in a block device.
  #
  # Basically a start/length pair with a block size.
  #
  # This is a wrapper for Storage::Region, but has a fundamental difference.
  # Y2Storage::Region.new receives the Storage::Region object to wrap as the
  # only parameter (as usual with Storage wrappers). To create an instance from
  # scratch (generating the corresponding Storage::Region in the process), use
  # Y2Storage::Region.create, that gets the same arguments than
  # Storage::Region.new.
