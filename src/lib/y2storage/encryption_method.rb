  # YaST provides different Encryption Methods to encrypt a block device. Not to be confused with the
  # encryption type ({EncryptionType} class) that represents the encryption technology used underneath
  # (e.g., LUKS1, PLAIN, etc).
  #
  # An Encryption Method is identified by a name and it encapsulates a set of steps to encrypt the
  # device.
  #
  # This class offers a catalog of possible Encryption Methods, see {EncryptionMethod.all}.
  #
  # @example
  #
  #   EncryptionMethod.all.first
  #   EncryptionMethod.available.first
  #   EncryptionMethod.find(:luks1)
  #   EncryptionMethod.find(:random_swap)
