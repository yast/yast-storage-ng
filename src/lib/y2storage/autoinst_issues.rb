module Y2Storage
  # Y2Storage::AutoinstIssues offers an API to register and report storage
  # related AutoYaST problems.
  #
  # Basically, it works by registering found problems when creating the
  # partitioning proposal (based on AutoYaST profile) and displaying them to
  # the user. Check {Y2Storage::AutoinstIssues::Issue} in order to
  # find out more details about the kind of problems.
  #
  # About registering errors, an instance of the
  # {Y2Storage::AutoinstIssues::List} will be used.
