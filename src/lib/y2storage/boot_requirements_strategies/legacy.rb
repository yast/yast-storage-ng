      # must leave space for Grub at the beginning of the partition (like ExtX
      # does) or must support embedding Grub in the filesystem (like Btrfs).
      # But that's a fragile approach that is discouraged by the Grub2
      # developers. In any case, it will not work with XFS since it leaves
      # no space at the beginning of the partition. It wouldn't work for LVM,
