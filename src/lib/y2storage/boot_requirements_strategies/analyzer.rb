      # This is relevant only in some strategies (mainly legacy boot).
      #
      # There is no way to query the system for such value, so this method
      # relies on #boot_disk_name. If that information is not available, the
      # disk hosting /boot or the first disk hosting the root filesystem is
      # considered to be the boot disk.
      #
      # If "/boot" or "/" are still not present neither in the devicegraph nor
      # in the list of planned devices, the first disk of the system is used as
      # fallback.
      #
      # FIXME: For RAID and LVM setups a list of disks would strictly be
      #   correct (the disks that constitute the /boot file system).
      #   The current approach is not that bad, though, as we don't have to
      #   actually install the bootloader but just check if it will work.
      #   Also, the extra partitions proposed are the *minimum* required to boot.
      #
      #   But particularly in asymmetric cases (like part of LVM on a GPT
      #   disk, part on a MS-DOS disk) we have a problem: the requirements
      #   will differ depending on which boot disk is picked (basically
      #   random). For this to work properly we'd have to switch to tracking
      #   all boot disks but this will also mean error messages like "BIOS
